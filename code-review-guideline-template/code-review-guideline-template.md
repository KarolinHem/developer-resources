# Code review guideline template
This code review guideline aims to provide an effective and efficient review process that aligns with the project's goals and focuses on the most important aspects of the code. Below are the steps to create your own code review guideline.

### 1. Goals and objectives of our code review process
Define the goals and objectives of the code review process.

Example:
```
Goals:

- To ensure that the code meets the project's functional and non-functional requirements
- To identify and correct defects in the code
- To improve the overall quality of the codebase
- To provide a mechanism for sharing knowledge and best practices among team members

Objectives:

- To review all code changes before they are merged into the main codebase
- To provide constructive feedback to developers to improve the quality of the code
- To ensure that the code is consistent with the coding standards and guidelines
- To ensure that the code is well-documented and easy to understand
- To identify and correct defects in the code
- To ensure that the code is scalable, maintainable, and extensible
- To identify and share best practices and knowledge among team members
```

### 2. Roles and responsibilities of each team member involved in the review process.
You should clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each team member involved in the review process.

Example:
```
Roles and Responsibilities:

- Author: The developer who submits the code for review
- Reviewer: The team member who reviews the code and provides feedback
- Lead Reviewer: The team member responsible for coordinating and overseeing the code review process
- Approver: The team member who approves or rejects the code changes after the review process
```

### 3. Scope and focus of code reviews
Defining the scope and focus of the code review is essential for ensuring that reviewers are focused on the most important aspects of the code.

Example:
```
Scope and Focus of Code Review:

- Define the scope of code review: Which files and areas of the code should be reviewed?
- Define the focus of code review: Which aspects of the code should be prioritized for review (e.g., functionality, performance, security)?
- Set guidelines for the size of pull requests: What is the maximum size of a pull request that can be reviewed effectively?
- Establish criteria for evaluating code: What criteria should be used to determine whether the code meets the project's standards and requirements?
- Communicate the guidelines clearly to team members: How should team members be informed of the guidelines, and how should they be enforced?
```

### 4. Standards for code formatting, commenting, and documentation.
Defining standards for code formatting, and code review in general is hard but mandatory to avoid frustration.

Example:
```
Standards for Code Formatting, Commenting, and Documentation:

- Identify the coding standards to follow: Which coding standards should be used, such as indentation, line spacing, and naming conventions? How many lines max per pull request (you should not [review more than 400 lines to reduce pickup time](https://axolo.co/blog/p/how-to-reduce-cycle-time))
- Define guidelines for commenting: What types of comments should be used, and where should they be placed in the code? How should comments be formatted?
- Set documentation requirements: What types of documentation are required, such as high-level design documents, API documentation, or user manuals? What is the expected level of detail?
- Determine the tools to be used: What tools will be used to ensure that code formatting, commenting, and documentation standards are enforced?
- Communicate the guidelines: How should team members be informed of the guidelines, and how should they be enforced?
```

### 5. Frequency and timing of code reviews

Example:
```
Frequency and Timing of Code Reviews:

- Define the frequency of code reviews: How often should code reviews be conducted (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly)? How long should they last?
- Determine the timing of code reviews: At what point in the development process should code reviews be conducted (e.g., before merging, after merging, or during testing)?
- Ensure integration into the development process: How should code reviews be integrated into the development process, and how should they be prioritized alongside other tasks?
```

### 6. Encourage a positive and constructive culture around code reviews, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and learning.
Encouraging a positive and constructive culture around code reviews is important to ensure that team members view code reviews as an opportunity for growth and collaboration. To encourage a positive culture, you should:

- Emphasize the importance of learning,
- Foster a collaborative environment,
- Recognize achievements and contributions,
- Regularly review and refine the culture around code reviews.
